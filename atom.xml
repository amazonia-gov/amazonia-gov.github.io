<hr>
<p>My fellow citizens!<br>
We are proud to usher in a new and hopeful 2022.<br>
The past 2021 is the first year since the establishment of the Republic of Amazonia. The Republic of Amazonia has achieved quite a few incredible achievements. We have launched a more beautiful national flag and national emblem, and we have signed the Republic of Amazonia Declaration of Independence, declaring to the world that we are an independent and sovereign state. The Republic of Amazonia has conquered a new territory in Attica, which has a long history, picturesque, and rich products, the Nea Emesa Metropolis, this lead us also join the big family of terran micronations. These achievements have made the Republic of Amazonia shine in the micronational world, and let the kindness, tolerance, and hospitality of the Amazonian people be widely known.<br>
Although in 2021, the COVID-19 is still raging around the world, and the pandemic has caused various inconveniences to the lives of compatriots and me, but the Republic of Amazonia has never been defeated by these difficulties. We are still in brilliant achievements have been made this year. I would like to thank my compatriots who have faced difficulties side by side, helped each other, and built the country together, and I would like to extend my sincere tribute to and all medical workers of Amazonia and all over the world who have tried their best to fight against the pandemic.<br>
This year, the new constitution of the Republic of Amazonia will be implemented to ensure that we have always protected basic human rights, empowered the people to participate in and discussed politics, and established more efficient government agencies, the Secretariate and the Censorate. The Republic of Amazonia will develop friendly and cooperative relations with all diplomatic countries and make active efforts to achieve lasting world peace.<br>
In the new year, I hope that we will work together and walk hand in hand, with the desire and determination to build an increasingly strong and prosperous micronation, with our unity, innovation, and enterprising will and ability, we will advance courageously in the renovations.<br>
I wish the people of Amazonia all over the country can realize their wishes, and I wish every Amazonian person be healthy and happy, and be in a beautiful mood every day of the coming year!<br>
Happy New Year! Auld Lang Syne!</p>
